# Prototype Pattern

## Example - shirt prototyping

### Requirements and acceptance criteria

- To have a shirt-cloner object and interface to ask for different types of shirts (white, black, and blue at 15.00,
  16.00, and 17.00 dollars respectively)

- When you ask for a white shirt, a clone of the white shirt must be made, and the new instance must be different from
  the original one

- The SKU of the created object shouldn't affect new object creation

- An info method must give me all the information available on the instance fields, including the updated SKU
