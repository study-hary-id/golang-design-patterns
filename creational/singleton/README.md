# Singleton Pattern

## Example - a unique counter

### Requirements and acceptance criteria

- When no counter has been created before, a new one is created with the value 0

- If a counter has already been created, return this instance that holds the actual count

- If we call the method AddOne, the count must be incremented by 1
