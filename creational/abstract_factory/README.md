# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Example - vehicle manufacturing

### Requirements and acceptance criteria

- We must retrieve a `Vehicle` object using a factory returned by the abstract factory.

- The vehicle must be a concrete implementation of a `Motorbike` or a
  `Car` that implements both interfaces (`Vehicle` and `Car` or `Vehicle`
  and `Motorbike`).
